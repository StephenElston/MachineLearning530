# Florance Nightingale: Data Scientist
# Do Sanitation Officers Matter?

## Overview and summary

During the Crimean War, at the urging of nurse Florence Nightingale, the British Army introduced sanitation officers to reduce preventable deaths in hospitals. 

Nightingale worked in British Army field hospitals during the Crimean War. She was shocked by the large number of preventable deaths among British soldiers in hospitals during the first year of the war. In fact, preventable deaths far exceeded the rate of death from combat injuries. At the urging of Nightingale, the British Parliament compelled the Army to introduce sanitation officers in March of 1856. The sanitation officers enforced sanitary practices in the Army hospitals with the goal of reducing preventable deaths.

Nightingale's analysis led to other innovations. Isambard Kingdom Brunel, the fammous British engineer, developed designs for portable military hospitals. These hospitals included features intended to improve patient care. Thus, Nightingales work as a data scientist reached beyond her profession of nursing. 

Nightingale used some innovative graphical methods to present the results from the data she had collected on the causes of deaths of British soldiers. In this report, I explore how modern analysis methods can be applied to this 160 year old data set. 

Analysis of these data, support Nightingale's conclusion that introducing Sanitation Officers did, in fact, reduce preventable deaths and from disease and other causes. At the 95% confidence level we can reject the null hypothesis that Sanitation Officers had no effect on the rate of preventable deaths. We can seee this resutl both from clasical t-tests and bootstrap tests. However, we cannot reject the hypothesis that combat deaths from wounds decreased following the introduction of Sanitation Officers, it is likely that the rate of combat deaths did not change.

## Nightingale's original graphic

Like all good data scientists, Florance Nightingale used visualization to both explore her data set and to present the results of her analysis to a skeptical British public and Parlament. Here is an image of the original graphic which Nightingale used to convince the British Parlament of the effectiveness of Sanitation Officers.

![Original Nightingale Graphic](C:\Users\StevePC2\Dropbox\UW\DataSci350\Summer 2016\Lecture 1\Nightingale-graphic.jpg)

This graphic is remarkable both for the amount of information displayed and was extraordinarily innovative considering the state of analytics in the 1850's. In our era we have many more tools at our disposal that Florance Nightingale could not have imagined. Let's have a look at what we can do with these tools.

## Load and explore the data set

As a first step load and explore the data.

```{r}
require(HistData)
dim(Nightingale)
summary(Nightingale)
```

The monthly values of a number of variables measuring the casualty rates of soliders in the British army are included in these data. A number of inteteresting aspects of the data set are apparent from this summary. The distributions of deaths from disease and wounds are highly skewed. This can be seen by the large gap between the means and the medians of these distributions. 


Ploting the size of the British Army for 24 months of the war shows the number of soldiers generally increased with time. 


```{r}
require(ggplot2)
ggplot(Nightingale, aes(Date, Army)) +
  geom_point(size = 5) + geom_line() +
  ggtitle('Size of the British Army in the Crimean War') +
  ylab('Size of Army')
```

The number of soldiers increased for the most of the duration of the war. 

Next, examine a plot the deaths of soldiers per 1,000 by month for 24 months of the war. The size of the Army is included for reference. 


```{r}
plot.line = function(col, color, ylab){
  ggplot(Nightingale) + 
    geom_line(aes_string('Date', col), color = color, size = 2) + ylab(ylab)
}

plot.Crimea = function(){
  require(gridExtra)
  p1 = plot.line("Wounds.rate", 'red', 'Rate of wounds')
  p1 = p1 + ggtitle('Casualty rates per 1000 by date for Crimean War + size of Army')
  p2 = plot.line("Other.rate", 'DarkBlue', 'Rate of other')
  p3 = plot.line("Disease.rate", 'black', 'Rate of disease')
  p4 = plot.line("Army", 'green', 'Size of Army')
  grid.arrange(p1, p2, p3, p4, nrow = 4)
}

plot.Crimea()
```

There is clearly a problem with these data. The rate of deaths from disease exceeds 1000 per month in January 1855. It is clearly not the case that more than 100% of British Army died in that month. These data need to be (re) scaled by the size of the army. 

Following normalization of the data, the following plot shows the causes of deaths of the soldiers by various causes. 

```{r}
colsIn = c("Disease", "Wounds", "Other")
colsOut = c("Disease.rate", "Wounds.rate", "Other.rate")
Nightingale[, colsOut] = lapply(colsIn, 
    function(x) 1000 * Nightingale[, x]/Nightingale$Army)
plot.Crimea()
```

The data now appear to be correctly normalized. The size of the Army increased during most of the war. However, the peak death rates from disease and other causes was in early 1855, just prior to the introduction of Sanitation Officers. 

We can gain additional insight from another view of these data by plotting them on the same vertical scale.


```{r}
ggplot(Nightingale) + 
  geom_line(aes(Date, Wounds.rate), color = 'red', size = 2) + ylab('Rate of wounds') +
  geom_line(aes(Date, Other.rate), color = 'DarkBlue', size = 2) + 
  geom_line(aes(Date, Disease.rate), color = 'black', size = 2) +
  ggtitle('Rate of casualties vs. Date') +
  ylab('Rate of casualities per 1000')
```

The death rate from disease, shown in black, far exceeds the death from other causes, shown in blue, and the death rate from combat wounds shown in red. Note that the death rate from disease is in sharp decline in early 1855 and continues to decline for the duration of the war. 

Finally, examine the pairwise scatter plots of the death rates from the various causes and the size of the deployed Army. 


```{r}
require(car)
scatterplotMatrix(~ Disease.rate + Wounds.rate + Other.rate + Army, data = Nightingale)
```

All of the variables plotted showed skewed distributions. Casualty rates are skewed to the left and Army size to the right. 

There appears to be some relationship between rate of deaths from disease and rate of deaths from other causes. There is no apparent relationship between the size of the Army and the other variables. Nor, is there any no noticeable relationship between deaths from combat wounds and deaths from diseases and other causes. 


## Are there meaningful correlations?

Having investigated some basic relationships in the data, we will look at the correlations between the variables. The following display shows these correlations.

```{r}
cols = c("Disease.rate", "Wounds.rate", "Other.rate", "Army")
cors = cor(Nightingale[, cols], method = 'pearson')
require(corrplot)
corrplot.mixed(cors, upper = "ellipse")
```

Deaths from disease and other causes are highly correlated. All other correlations are small.



## Examine the distribution of these data

Let's have a look at the distribution of casualties in these data. These data have been grouped by time, before and after March 1855 when the Sanitation Officers were introduced. 

```{r}
## Divide data into before and after March 1885
before = Nightingale[Nightingale$Date <= '1855-03-01', ]
dim(before)
after = Nightingale[Nightingale$Date > '1855-03-01', ]
dim(after)
xlims = range(Nightingale$Disease.rate)
xlims
p1 = ggplot(before, aes(Disease.rate)) + geom_density(color = 'red') + 
  geom_histogram(aes(y = ..density..), alpha = .2) + xlim(xlims) +
  ggtitle('Rate of deaths from disease before and after March 1955') +
  xlab('Disease death rate')
p2 = ggplot(after, aes(Disease.rate)) + geom_density(color = 'red') + 
  geom_histogram(aes(y = ..density..), alpha = .2) + xlim(xlims) +
  xlab('Disease death rate')
grid.arrange(p1, p2, nrow = 2)
```

It certainly does appear that there is a difference in the distribution of preventable deaths before and after March 1855.

But, how does the distribution of combat deaths change? These historgrams show this comparison.

```{r}
xlims = range(Nightingale$Wounds.rate)
xlims
p1 = ggplot(before, aes(Wounds.rate)) + geom_density(color = 'red') + 
  geom_histogram(aes(y = ..density..), alpha = .2) + xlim(xlims) +
  ggtitle('Rate of deaths from wounds before and after March 1955') +
  xlab('Wound death rate')
p2 = ggplot(after, aes(Wounds.rate)) + geom_density(color = 'red') + 
  geom_histogram(aes(y = ..density..), alpha = .2) + xlim(xlims) +
  xlab('Wound death rate')
grid.arrange(p1, p2, nrow = 2)
```

There does not seem to be much difference  in the combat death rate between the two time periods. 

## Compare casualty rates before and after March 1855

We can now compare the casualty rate before and after the Sanitation Officers were introduced in March 1856. 

### Deaths from Disease

In order to study the differences in causes of deaths of British soldiers before and after March 1855, the data set is divided into two. 


```{r}
before = Nightingale[Nightingale$Date <= '1855-03-01', ]
dim(before)
after = Nightingale[Nightingale$Date > '1855-03-01', ]
dim(after)
```

First, examine the differences in the values of preventable deaths for the two time periods. The histogram shows the distribution of values of deaths from disease before and after March 1855. The solid red line shows the mean and the dashed red lines show the upper and lower 95% confidence intervals.


```{r}
plot.t <- function(a, b, cols = c('before', 'after'), nbins = 40, p = 0.05){
  maxs = max(c(max(a), max(b)))
  mins = min(c(min(a), min(b)))
  breaks = seq(maxs, mins, length.out = (nbins + 1))
  par(mfrow = c(2, 1))
  hist(a, breaks = breaks, main = paste('Histogram of deaths', cols[1], 'March 1855'), xlab = cols[1])
  abline(v = mean(a), lwd = 4, col = 'red')
  abline(v = quantile(a, probs = p/2), lty = 3, col = 'red', lwd = 3)  
  abline(v = quantile(a, probs = (1 - p/2)), lty = 3, col = 'red', lwd = 3)
  hist(b, breaks = breaks, main = paste('Histogram of deaths', cols[2], 'March 1855'), xlab = cols[2])
  abline(v = mean(b), lwd = 4, col = 'red')
  abline(v = quantile(b, probs = p/2), lty = 3, col = 'red', lwd = 3)  
  abline(v = quantile(b, probs = (1 - p/2)), lty = 3, col = 'red', lwd = 3)
  par(mfrow = c(1, 1))
}
plot.t(before$Disease.rate, after$Disease.rate)
```

The monthly deaths from disease are clustered at the low end of the histogram after March 1855. This indicates that indicates that the death rate was lower after the introduction of the Sanitation Officers. 

But, is this reduction in death rate between these two time periods significant? A t-test is often used to compare the difference in means. The null hypothesis is that there is no difference in the means. 

```{r}
t.test(before$Disease.rate, after$Disease.rate)
```
The t statistic is nearly 3 on 12 degrees of freedom. Further, the p-value is less than 0.05. Further, the 95% confidence interval does not include zero. From these results, we can reject the null hypthesis. 

There are so few data for each time period, indicated by the 12 degrees of freedom from the t test. A bootstrap resampling of the difference of the means is likely to be a better approach. The results of applying the bootstrap method are shown in the following figure.


```{r}
require(simpleboot)
disease.boot = two.boot(after$Disease.rate, before$Disease.rate, mean, R = 100000)

plot.diff <- function(a, cols = 'bootstrap difference of means', nbins = 80, p = 0.05){
  maxs = max(a)
  mins = min(a)
  breaks = seq(maxs, mins, length.out = (nbins + 1))
  hist(a, breaks = breaks, main = paste('Histogram of', cols), xlab = cols)
  abline(v = mean(a), lwd = 4, col = 'red')
  abline(v = 0, lwd = 4, col = 'blue')
  abline(v = quantile(a, probs = p/2), lty = 3, col = 'red', lwd = 3)  
  abline(v = quantile(a, probs = (1 - p/2)), lty = 3, col = 'red', lwd = 3)
}

plot.diff(disease.boot$t)
```

You can see from the plot that there is a significant difference in means between the preventable deaths from disease before and after Sanitation Officers were introduced. The 0 value is well outside the 95% confidence interval.We can reject the null hypothesis that there is no difference in the mean rate of deaths.   

### Deaths from Other Causes

Now compare the difference between deaths from other causes before and Sanitation Officers were introduced. The plots show the histograms of the death rate from other causes by month.


```{r}
plot.t(before$Other.rate, after$Other.rate)
```

The histogram shows that monthly deaths from other causes are clustered at the low end of the values after March 1855. 

The t-test is used again to deterimine if the difference in the means is significant.

```{r}
t.test(before$Other.rate, after$Other.rate)
```
The results are similar to those obtained for disease death rates. Once again the t-test indicates the null hypothesis that the means are the same can be rejected.

As before, the number of samples and the degrees of freedom are rather small. Bootstraping the difference in means can provide a more reliable result.  

````{r}
other.boot = two.boot(after$Other.rate, before$Other.rate, mean, R = 100000)
plot.diff(other.boot$t)
```

You can see from the plot of bootstrapped mean differences that the 0 value is well outside the 95% confidence interval. We can reject the null hypothesis that there is no difference in the mean rate of deaths.

### Deaths from Combat Wounds

Now compare the difference between deaths from combat wounds before and Sanitation Officers were introduced. The plots show the histograms of the death rate from combat wounds by month. 
 


```{r}
plot.t(before$Wounds.rate, after$Wounds.rate)
```

The histogram shows that monthly deaths from combat wounds have similar distributions of values both before and after March 1855. 

The t-test is used again to deterimine if the difference in the means is significant.

```{r}
t.test(before$Wounds.rate, after$Wounds.rate)
```
In this case, the t-statistic is rather small and the p-value is large. Further, the 95% confidence interval includes zero. We cannot reject the null hypothesis. 

There are again few data for each time period. A bootstrap resampling of the difference of the means is likely to be a better approach. The results of applying the bootstrap method are shown in the following figure.

```{r}
wound.boot = two.boot(after$Wounds.rate, before$Wounds.rate, mean, R = 100000)
plot.diff(wound.boot$t)
```

You can see from the plot of bootstrapped mean difference that it is nearly at the 0 value well within the 95% confidence interval. We cannot reject the null hypothesis that there is no difference in the mean rate of deaths.

## Conclusion

This analysis supports Nightingale's original conjecture that introduction of Sanitation Officers significantly reduced the rate of death amoung soldier from preventable causes. Using several methods it is shown that  the introduction of Sanitation Officers significantly reduced the rate of preventable deaths, primarily from disease. The rate of death from other causes was also significantly reduced after March 1855. Intoducton of Sanitation Officers had no effect on combat death rates.
