Data scientists spend a lot of time manipulating data to clean and prepare it (**data munging**) and to understand the relationships within the variables in the data (**data exporation**). Visualization is a key skill for any data scientist performing these tasks. \n",

    "Before performing any type of inference or machine learning on a data set, you should develop an underestanding of the relationships in the data set. Skipping this step can lead wasted time from unexpected problems when building models, or in constructing models with poor performance. When starting any data scince project, it is a good idea to plan on spending considerable time exploring the data. These exploration steps are often perfomed in conjunction with data cleaning and preparing, as visualiation often highlights problems with data. \n",
