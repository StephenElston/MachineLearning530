    "In the previous lesson we explored Monte Carlo **reinforcement learning**. MC RL required that the returns for an entire episode be computed before any values are available for use. The disadvantage of this approach is the the full set of returns are required for state value or action value estimates. But, how can we get state values or action-values in fewer time steps? It turns out there are algorithms which compute estimates in as few as one step. In this lesson will focus on i) a state-value estimation algorithm known as **time difference learning**, ii) **TD-learning** and control algorithm known as **SARSA** and an **off-policy** algorithm known as **Q-Learning**. \n",

    "- **No Markov model** needs to be specified for reinforcement learning, in contrast to dynamic programming.\n",
    "- Like dynamic programming, reinforcement learning **optimizes a reward function**. This is in contrast to supervised and unsupervised learning which use an error or objective function.  \n",
    "- Reinforcement learning algorithms learn by **experience**. Over time, the algorithm learns a model of the environment and these results are used to optimize the expected reward. Learning from experience is in contrast to supervised learning which uses known marked cases. \n",
    "- Reinforcement learning agents take **actions** and only receive **state** and **rewards** from the environment. These are the only interaction between the RL agent and the environment.    \n",

    "The ability to learn from experience is an attractive concept. This method of learning seems to mimic human learning. However, reinforcement learning has proven difficult to use in real-world applications. For a review of successes and problems arising when applying RL to robotics see [Kobler et. al.](https://www.ias.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/uploads/Publications/Kober_IJRR_2013.pdf). At the present time, RL has mostly succeeded in cases where simulations can be used to gain experience. \n",

    "## TD Prediction Model\n",
    "\n",
    "In a previous lesson we examined a general update model:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$NewValue = OldValue + LearningRate * ErrorTerm$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Following this general formulation the update for TD state value can be written as:\n",

    "$$V_{t+1}(S_{t}) = V_t(S_t) + \\alpha \\big[ G_t - V_t(S_t) \\big]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here,   \n",
    "$\\alpha = $ the learning rate,      \n",
    "$\\big[ G_t - V_t(S_t) \\big] = $ the TD error term is the difference between the return $G_t$ and the value, $V(S_t)$. The return is identical to the state value at convergence, making the error 0.   \n",
    "\n",
    "   \n",
    "Using the same general formulation we can create and single time step update model know as the **one step time difference** or **TD(0)** algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$V_{t+1}(S_{t}) = V_t(S_t) + \\alpha \\big[ R_{t+1} + V_{t+1}(S_{t+1}) - V_t(S_t) \\big]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where,  \n",
    "$\\delta_t =  R_{t+1} + V_{t+1}(S_{t+1}) - V_t(S_t) = $ the one-step **TD error**,  \n",
    "$R_{t+1} = $ the return for the next time step,   \n",

    "$V_{t+1}(S_{t+1}) = $ the bootstrap state-value for the successor state, $S_{t+1}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Like dynamic programming algorithms, the TD algorithm **bootstraps**. The return and estimated value at the next time step, $V_{t+1}(S_{t+1})$, are from previous samples. However, unlike MC RL which does not bootstrap, the TD(0) algorithm produces an estimate of $V_{t+1}(S_t)$ in only one time step, rather than waiting to reach the terminal state at the end of the episode. This fact can be seen by examining the backup diagram shown below:\n",

    "## Example of Time Difference RL\n",
    "\n",
    "With this short introduction TD RL in mind, let's try an example. We will sample the value function using a basic TD(0) algorithm here. \n",
    "\n",
    "As discussed in other labs, **Navigation** to a goal is a significant problem in robotics. Real-world navigation is rather complex. Therefore, in this example we will use a simple analog called a **grid world**. The grid world for this problem is shown below. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"img/GridWorld.JPG\" alt=\"Drawing\" style=\"width:200px; height:200px\"/>\n",
    "<center> **A 4x4 Grid World with Terminal State** </center>\n",
    "\n",
    "The grid world consists of a 4x4 set of positions the robot can occupy. Each position is considered a state. The goal is to navigate to state 0, the goal, in the minimum steps. We will explore methods to find policies which reach this goal and achieve maximum reward. \n",
    "\n",
    "Grid position 0 is the goal and a **terminal state**. There are no possible state transitions out of this position. The presence of a terminal state makes this an **episodic Markov random process**. For each episode sampled the robot can start in any other random position, $\\{ 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15 \\}$. This random selection process makes this a **random start** TD algorithm. The episode terminates when the robot enters the terminal position (state 0).  \n",
    "\n",
    "In reality, an RL agent may need to explore to find the possible actions when it is in some particular state. To simplify our example, we encode, or represent, these possibilities in a dictionary as shown in the code block below. We use a dictionary of dictionaries to perform the lookup. The keys of the outer dictionary are the identifiers (numbers) of the states. The keys of the inner dictionary are the possible actions and the values are the **successor state**, $s'$, for that transition.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In each state, there are four possible actions the robot can take:\n",
    "- up, u\n",
    "- down, d,\n",
    "- left, l\n",
    "- right, r\n",
    "\n",
    "The TD RL agent has no model for the environment. Therefore, beyond these allowed actions, all other information is encapsulated in the environment and is unobservable by the agent. This is the key difference between reinforcement learning and dynamic programming. "

    "### Double Q-Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "The Q-learning algorithm just presented has a significant **bias**. To understand why this might be consider the following thought experiment. In most cases the sampled action values are inaccurate. Some action values will have a positive error and some will have a negative error. In the error is on the order of the values themselves, the $max_a$ operator has a reasonable chance of selecting an action value that is the largest because of this error. However, the $max_a$ operator will never select an action with a low value simply because of the errors. The net result is a bias toward action values with the largest positive error. \n",
    "\n",
    "What can be done to correct this situation? One relatively simple and effective algorithm is known as **double Q-learning**. Double Q-learning maintains two tables of action values. The values from one table are used to perform the bootstrap updates of the other table and vice versa. This approach averages out the bias. For two tables, $Q_1$ and $Q_2$ we can express double Q-learning as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$Q_1(S_t,A_t) = Q_1(S_t,A_t) + \\alpha \\big[ R_{t+1} + \\gamma Q_2 \\big( S_{t+1},argmax_a Q_1(S_{t+1} , a) \\big) - Q_1(S_t,A_t) \\big] \\\\\n",

    "\n",
    "With a 0.5 probability one or the other of these expressions is used for the TD update at each time step. While double Q-learning requires twice as much memory, to maintain the two tables, the computational complexity is the same when compared to Q-learning. \n",
