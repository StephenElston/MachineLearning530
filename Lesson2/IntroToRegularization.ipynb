    "## 1.0 Why do we need regularization for deep learning?\n",
    "\n",
    "Deep learning models have a great many parameters (weights) which must be fit. This situation arises from the wide and deep architectures that are required to achieve significant **model capacity** for representing complex functions. The core issue is that over-fit models will simply learn the training data and **over-fit models do not generalize**. Therefore, regularization methods are required in order to prevent over-fitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, we can point to three interrelated problems with training deep neural networks:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Neural network models have large numbers of parameters (weights). With any finite size data set, there is likely to be a low ratio of cases per parameter or low ratio of cases to features. For example, if we are classifying 512 x 512 images with 1,000,000 training cases there are only about 4 cases per feature. This is why training neural networks often requires massive amounts of data. \n",
    "2. As a result of the large numbers of parameters, neural networks are susceptible to noise in the training data. Neural networks are generally considered less robust to noise than shallow machine learning methods. \n",
    "3. Presumably as a result of the model complexity, neural networks often return unexpected predictions for data cases outside the training data domain. This property has been referred to as **brittleness**. Brittleness has proven to be serious problem in some production systems. \n",
    "\n",
    "The regularization methods presented here will limit these effects. However, there is no 'silver bullet'! Neural networks are hard to train under the best of circumstances. "

    "### 1.1 Bias-variance trade-off\n",
    "\n",
    "When applying regularization one must come to terms with the **bias-variance trade-off**. Here are some simple examples of extreme cases:\n",
    "\n",
    "- If we say that our prediction for all cases is just the mean (or median), we have minimized the variance. The estimate for all cases is the same, so the bias of the estimates is zero. However, there is likely considerable variance in these estimates. \n",
    "- On the other hand, we can fit the same data with a kNN model with k=1. The training data will fit this model perfectly, since there  is one model coefficient per training data point. The variance will be low. On the other had the model will have considerable bias when applied to test data. \n",
    "\n",
    "In either case, these extreme models will not generalize well and will exhibit large errors on any independent test data. Any practical model must come to terms with the trade-off between bias and variance to make accurate predictions. \n",
    "\n",
    "To better understand this trade-off let's decompose mean square error for a model as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\Delta y = E \\big[ Y - \\hat{f}(X) \\big]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where,     \n",
    "$Y = $ the label vector.  \n",
    "$X = $ the feature matrix.   \n",
    "$\\hat{f}(x) = $ the trained model.   \n",
    "\n",
    "Expanding this relation gives us:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\Delta x = \\big( E[ \\hat{f}(X)] - \\hat{f}(X) \\big)^2 + E \\big[ ( \\hat{f}(X) - E[ \\hat{f}(X)])^2 \\big] + \\sigma^2\\\\\n",
    "\\Delta x = Bias^2 + Variance + Irreducible\\ Error$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Regularization will reduce variance, but increase bias. Regularization parameters must be chosen to minimize minimize $\\Delta x$. In many cases, this will prove challenging. \n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that the **irreducible error** is the limit of model accuracy. Even if we had a perfect model with no bias or variance, the irreducible error is inherent in the data and problem. "

    "## 2.0 l2 regularization\n",
    "\n",
    "We will now explore one of the mostly widely used regularization methods, often referred to as l2 regularization. \n",

    "The same method goes by some other names, as it has been 'invented' several times. In particular this method is known as, **Tikhonov regularization**, **l2 norm regularization**, **pre-whitening** in engineering, and for linear models **ridge regression**. In all likelihood the method was first developed by the Russian mathematician Andrey Tikhonov in the late 1940's. His work was not widely known in the West since his short book on the subject, [Solution of Ill-Posed Problems](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/44438630_Solutions_of_ill-posed_problems_Andrey_N_Tikhonov_and_Vasiliy_Y_Arsenin), was only published in English in 1977, about 30 years after it had appeared in Russian.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "So, what is the basic idea? l2 regularization applies a **penalty** proportional to the **l2** or **Euclidean norm** of the model weights to the loss function. The total loss function then becomes:  \n",
    "\n",
    "$$J(W) = J_{MLE}(W) + \\lambda ||W||^2$$\n",

    "\n",
    "You can think of this penalty as constraining the 12 or Euclidean norm of the model weight vector. The value of the hyperparameter $\\lambda$ determines how much the norm of the coefficient vector constrains the solution.

It is important to note that l2 regularization is a **soft constraint**. Coefficients are driven close to, but likely not exactly to, zero.   \n",

Here, we will use a simple approach of adding **white noise** to existing training cases to create new cases. By white noise we mean broad spectrum noise, specifically Normally distributed noise.  \n",

    "The idea of prewhitening has a long history in various disciplines, such as signal processing, image processing and control theory. The idea is simple. Normally distributed noise is added to the training data to create data cases with lower autocorrelation properties. \n",

Therefore, the covariance matrix is positive definite, and with no zero eigenvalues. This point is critical. If the augmentation method does not produce iid results, the model will have unwanted collinearities.  \n",

    "If we have a matrix of features $X$ and labels $y$, we can create an augmented model matrix by concatenating a matrix $X + G$ onto the original $X$. The resulting model matrix has the same number of columns but with augmented rows. Since we have constructed $G$ to have a favorable covariance function out augmented model matrix will inherit some so this favorable characteristic.  \n",
