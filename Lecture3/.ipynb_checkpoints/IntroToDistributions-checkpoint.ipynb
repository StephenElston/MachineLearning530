    "\n",
    "1. Discrete distributions\n",
    " - Descrete distributions are used to model the probability of events with discrete outcomes or states. \n",
    " - We call the distribution function the **Probability Mass Function**.\n",
    " - The sum of the probabilities of all possible events must equal 1.\n",
    " - The probability of event is equal to the value of distribution at that point.\n",
    " - All probabilities are strictly in the range 0-1.\n",
    "2. Continious distributions\n",
    " - Continious distributions have an infinite number of possible outcomes. The distribution measures the probability for some range of values. \n",
    " - We call the distribution function the **Probability Density Function**. \n",
    " - The probability of a range of values of an event equals the **area** under density curve over that range of values.\n",
    " - Probabilities cannot have negative values.\n",
    " - The probability of any single, exact value, is 0."
