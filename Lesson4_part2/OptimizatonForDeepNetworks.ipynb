    "Deep neural networks are trained by **learning** a set of weights. The optimal weights are learned by **minimizing the loss function** for the neural network. This minimization is performed using an **optimization algorithm**. Thus, optimization algorithms are an essential component in our neural network tool box.   \n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson you will become familiar with the basic optimization algorithms used to train deep neural networks, along with their pitfalls. The nonlinear nature of neural networks leads to several serious problems with local gradients. As a result of the multiple nonlinearities the local gradient can exhibit complex behavior. Further, the local gradient can be quite different from the larger-scale global behavior of the loss function gradient. \n",

    "The high dimensionality of the neural network training optimization problems makes detailed understanding of optimization behavior extremely difficult. There is one dimension for each model weight (parameter). Thus, the optimization is performed over a non-linear surface with millions of dimensions. Despite several decades of research much of the measurable progress has been based on empirical experience rather than theory.   \n",

Vanishing gradients arise when multiple small gradients are encountered in backpropagation. Exploding gradients arise when rapid changes in the loss function, sometimes referred to as **cliffs**, are encountered in the loss function.   \n",

    "\n",
    "Exploding gradients arise from sudden changes in curvature of the loss function. Encountering these 'cliffs' results in a gradient decent algorithm overshooting the minimum point, sometimes by an extreme amount.

Since only some eigenvalues grow large, the condition number becomes extremely large.  This leads to the exploding gradient! \n",

    "Up until now, we have been worked with algorithms with constant learning rates. In many cases, the gradient of the loss function will change multiple times before convergence is achieved. For example, the gradient may decrease and then increase again. In these cases, a constant learning rate results in slow convergence. There are several possible approaches to changing learning rates of optimization algorithms. \n",

This approach is effective in cases where the gradient decreases fairly steadily as the optimization proceeds.

We have seen this behavior in the foregoing SGD examples.    \n",

Ideally, if the learning rate should increase when plateaus and poorly conditioned areas of the loss function are encountered. The learning rate should decrease when the gradient of the loss function is better behaved. In practice, these ideals are hard to achieve and researchers have created many algorithms using various heuristics to adapt learning rate. "

    "- Some weights will become **stuck** at the initial value and are never learned. This is special case of the first problem, for the most part. \n",
    "\n",
    "Fortunately, the solution to this problem is simple; **randomize** the starting values of the weights.  This process is sometimes referred to as adding **fuzz** to the initial weights. A number of schemes have been tried. For example, initial weight values can be drawn from a Gaussian or Normal distribution. In practice, drawing the initial values from a Uniform distribution works as well as any other scheme.    "
