    "Starting with this lesson, we will turn our attention to a **reinforcement learning**. Reinforcement learning is a distinctive type of machine learning, differing from supervised learning and unsupervised learning. \n",
    "\n",
    "Reinforcement learning has several characteristics, which differentiate this method from other machine learning and from dynamic programming. The table below outlines key differences between the model types:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "| Model Type | Environment Model | State | Labeled Data | Loss Function |\n",
    "| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :----- |\n",

    "Some highlights of these differences include:  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Like dynamic programming, reinforcement learning **optimizes a reward function**. This is in contrast to supervised and unsupervised learning which attempt to minimize error or loss function.  \n",
    "- **No Markov model** needs to be specified for reinforcement learning, in contrast to dynamic programming.\n",
    "- Reinforcement learning algorithms learn by **experience**. Over time, the algorithm learns a model of the environment and these results are used to optimize the expected reward. Learning from experience is in contrast to supervised learning which uses marked cases (labels).  \n",
    "- Reinforcement learning agents take **actions** and only receive **state** and **rewards** from the environment. These are the only interaction between the RL agent and the environment.   \n",
    "\n",
    "The interaction between a reinforcement learning agent and the environment are illustrated in the figure below. Notice that the only feedback the agent receives from the environment is the reward and and state information. The agent receives no other evidence.   \n",

    "A wide variety of reinforcement learning algorithms have been developed over the past few decades. In this lesson we will explore the basics of the Monte Carlo method. Monte Carlo algorithms have been known for most of the history of reinforcement learning. However, they are generally considered inefficient for several reasons that will become apparent as we proceed:\n",
    "1. Monte Carlo methods rely large numbers of **random samples** to produce estimates. Thus, Monte Carlo algorithms are inherently computationally intensive. \n",

    "\n",
    "Monte Carlo sampling was developed in the 1940s. Originally, Monte Carlo methods were used to compute estimates of complex functions which where analytically intractable. The basic idea is to **compute an estimate** of a complex function by **averaging a large number of samples**. \n",
    "\n",
    "Monte Carlo methods rely on the [**weak law of large numbers**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_large_numbers). The law of large numbers is a theorem that states that statistics of independent samples converge to the population values as more unbiased experiments are performed. We can write this mathematically for the **expected value** pr mean as:\n",

    "$$Let\\ \\bar{X} = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^{n} X_i\\\\\n",

    "\\bar{X} \\rightarrow E(X) = \\mu\\\\\n",
    "as\\\\\n",

    "### Monte Carlo Reinforcement Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "But, how do we apply Monte Carlo sampling to reinforcement learning? More specifically, how do we apply Monte Carlo sampling to **episodic** reinforcement learning tasks. \n",
    "\n",
    "To understand this algorithm, it helps to examine the backup diagram shown below. This diagram shows Monte Carlo sampling of a single episode.    \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"img/MC_Backup.JPG\" alt=\"Drawing\" style=\"width:75px; height:400px\"/>\n",
    "<center> **Backup Diagram for Monte Carlo Reinforcement Learning** </center>  \n",
    "\n",
    "Starting at the top of the diagram the system is in a state, s. An action, a, causes a transition to a new state. The sampling of the episode proceeds until the terminal state, t, is reached. The return for the initial state can only be computed once the Monte Carlo backup **ends at the terminal state**. In other words, **Monte Carlo algorithms do not bootstrap**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In reinforcement learning we do not know the model. But, the agent can take a series of actions and find the rewards for these actions. For each episode the agent will accumulate the history of rewards for each action, given the state. \n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that for a finite or episodic Markov reward processes we define the **return** for state transitions starting with the current state. The return, or gain, is the sum of the rewards for the $T$ future states transitions of the episodic process, and can be expressed as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$G_t = R_{t+1} + R_{t+2} + \\ldots = R_{T}= \\sum_{k = 0}^{T} R_{t+k+1}$$ \n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, for any episode the Monte Carlo algorithm will sample the return for the states visited. Over a large (actually infinite) number of episodes the Monte Carlo algorithm will sample each action value several times. The sampled return values are then averaged for each state action. This process will converge to the actual action values, which are **unobservable** directly. \n",
    "\n",
    "For sampling a single episode of a Markov process, the Monte Carlo algorithm may or may not visit a state one or more times. The question then becomes, How should returns be computed if a state is visited more than once in an episode? There are two options each of which has different statical convergence properties:\n",
    "1. **First visit** Monte Carlo estimates returns from rewards from the first visit to a state in an episode. We will use first visit Monte Carlo in this lesson.\n",
    "2. **Every visit** Monte Carlo accumulates the rewards for any visit to a state in an episode.\n"

    "<center> **A 4x4 Grid World with Terminal State** </center>\n",
    "\n",
    "The grid world consists of a 4x4 set of positions the robot can occupy. Each position is considered a state. The goal is to navigate to state 0, the goal, in the minimum steps. We will explore methods to find policies which reach this goal and achieve maximum reward. \n",
    "\n",
    "Grid position 0 is the goal and a **terminal state**. There are no possible state transitions out of this position. The presence of a terminal state makes this an **episodic Markov random process**. For each episode sampled the robot can start in any other random position, $\\{ 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15 \\}$. This random selection process makes this a **random start** Monte Carlo algorithm. The episode terminates when the robot enters the terminal position (state 0).  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In reality, an RL agent may need to explore to find the possible actions when it is in some particular state. To simplify our example, we encode, or represent, these possibilities in a dictionary as shown in the code block below. We use a dictionary of dictionaries to perform the lookup. The keys of the outer dictionary are the identifiers (numbers) of the states. The keys of the inner dictionary are the possible actions and the values are the **successor state**, $s'$, for that transition.  \n",

    "The MC RL agent has no model. Therefore, beyond these allowed actions, all other information is encapsulated in the environment and is unobservable by the agent. This is the key difference between reinforcement learning and dynamic programming. "
