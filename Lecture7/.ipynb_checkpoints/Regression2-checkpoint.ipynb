    "Overfitting or over-parameterizatio of machine learning models arrises in any case where the number of model parameters exceeds the effective dimensions of the feature set. This is most often the result of linear dependency between the features. However, using too complex a model can lead to similar problems. In the extreme case, imagine a model with as many free parameters as training cases. This model might fit the training data perfectly, but will show unstable and unexpected results when used for any other data. In machine learning terminology, we say that such an unstable model does not **generalize**. \n",
