    "- **Select a criteria to evaluate the hypothesis:** If our sample has a probability of $>= 90\\%$ chance that the increase could be caused by randomness alone we will reject the null hypthesis that the logo does not mater.\n",

    "  - $H_0 =$ The old website drives equal amount of traffic.\n",
    "  - $H_a =$ The new website drives different traffic than the old one.\n",

    "Based on our findings we can only do two things\n",
    "- **Reject the null-hypothesis:** Since the alternative covers all other possibilities, we can say we accept the alternative hypothesis.\n",
    "- **Fail to reject the null hypothesis:**  We accept the null hypothesis because we have already believed our null hypothesis from the start. We can fail for two reasons:\n",
    "  - The alternative hypothesis was false to begin with.\n",

    "\n",
    "With the increasing scale of data sets in the 21st Century, problems with the correct applicaton of classical tests have been amplified. The primary issue is with false positives, or **Type I errors**. This problem is known as the problem of **multiple comparisons** or **base rate fallacy**. \n",
    "\n",
    "To understand this problem lets look at a simple example. If we have 7 groups, there are 21 possible interactions between the groups. If we use a t-test with a significance level of 0.05, we expect there to be one false positive, even if the null hypothesis is true in all cases. \n",
    "\n",
    "These problems grow as the number of groups grow. As an example, consider classifing several millions objects from images. \n",
    "\n",
    "When there are relatively few groups with a great many cases there is no problem. The test will have ample power.\n",
    "\n",
    "With large numbers of groups, there is a high probability of getting a false positive, or type I error, with ANOVA. Without any way to know which groups are different, it is nearly impossible to determine which group may or may not be different from the rest of the population. This is a manifestation of the base rate fallacy. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Bonfirroni correction  \n",
    "\n",

    "The problem with the Bonfirroni correction is the reduction in power as the  grows smaller. For big data problems with large numbers of groups, this issue can be especially serious. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Confidence and credible intervals\n",
    "\n",
    "Another approach to the base rate falacy problem is to use **confidence intervals**. For example, one can compute the confidence intervals of the distributions of differences of means between groups. We have just seen an example with Tukeys HSD method. \n",
