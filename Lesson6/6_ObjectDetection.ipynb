Go to [this page](https://keras.io/examples/vision/retinanet/), and click **View in Colab**. Once the notebook launches in Colab read the provided commentary and examine the code for each cell. Then, execute the code all the cells in order. The model will be trained for 100 epochs, with each epoch requiring considerable computing time. \n",

    "> **Exercise 6-2:** Examine the code for the `FeaturePyramid` class. The `__init__` method creates the backbone CNN. Looking at the `get_backbone` function shows that it instantiates a ResNet50 model and returning feature maps at several depths from the model.  The `__init__` method then defines the convolution operators and an up-sample operation for the FPN. Keeping in mind the behavior of the [keras.layers.Conv2D](https://keras.io/api/layers/convolution_layers/convolution2d/) and [keras.layers.UpSampling2D](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/layers/UpSampling2D) functions, answer the following questions:   \n",
