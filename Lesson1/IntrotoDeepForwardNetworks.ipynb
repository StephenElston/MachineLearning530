    "### 1.1 Why is deep learning important?\n",
    "\n",
    "Deep learning methods are a form of **artificial intelligence (AI)** or **machine intelligence**. More specifically, deep learning algorithms are a type of **machine learning**. \n",
    "\n",
    "What properties does machine intelligence require? There have been many answers to this question over the history of computing. In this case, we will take a practical view, sometimes known as **weak AI**. There are three key properties an intelligent machine must have. Deep learning algorithms are one of a few classes of algorithms that can do the following, essential to machine intelligence:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Representation:** An intelligent machine must be able to represent a model of the world it interacts with in a general manner. Representation is key to intelligence. Without a good representation the best learning and inference algorithms will struggle. Whereas, good representation can greatly facilitate learning and inference. In conventional machine learning the representation is model and a set of features. The representation is limited to what the features can provide directly. Deep learning algorithms, on the other hand, learn learn complex representations from raw features. This behavior allows deep learning algorithms to approximate complex relationships. Further, the representations learned often generalize well, up to a point. \n",
    "2. **Learning:** As you likely guessed from the very name, deep learning algorithms learn from data. Whereas, conventional machine learning is focused on inference,deep learning algorithms learn both inference and representations. As a result, deep leaning algorithms are more complex and therefore harder to train than conventional machine learning algorithms.  \n",
    "3. **Inference:** Any machine intelligence algorithm must be able to perform inference. The inference is the result produced given new input data. To be useful, the inferences produced by a machine intelligence algorithm must **generalize** beyond the cases used for learning or training. Good generalization requires both good representations and learning which can deal with the complexity of diverse situations. Some deep learning algorithms can approach human levels of performance in inference tasks such as recognizing objects in images or understanding natural speech. \n",
    "\n",
    "The figure below shows a highly abstracted view of machine intelligence, showing the relationship between representation, learning and inference. In simple terms, the representation is learned and then used to make inferences. Errors in the inferences can be used to improve the learning of the representation.   \n",

He built on the earlier attempts at a neural network models by McCulloch and Pitts (1943) and Heeb (1949). The perceptron adds **nonlinear activation** to the afine network. \n",

The failure of the preceptron to learn an **exclusive or (XOR)** function is well known. See for example, Section 6.1 in GBC. \n",

To represent more complex functions, we need a more complex network. In more technical terms we need a network with greater **model capacity**. \n",

    "### 2.4 Neural network architectures - Finding representations\n",
    "\n",
    "The representations achievable by neural network with just a single hidden layer  are quite powerful. In fact, Cybenko (1989) showed that such a network with an infinite number of hidden units using sigmoidal activation can approximate any arbitrary function. Hornik (1991) generalized this to apply to any activation function. We call this theorem the **universal approximation theorem**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "A universal approximation theorem may see like a really exciting development; especially if you are a machine intelligence nerd. However, one must be circumspect when viewing such a result. A representation with an infinite number of nodes cannot be learned in any practical sense. Still it is comforting to know that, at least in principle, a representation can be learned for arbitrarily complex problems. \n",
    "\n",
    "While infinitely wide networks with a single layer are unrealistic, we are not limited to one dimension. In fact, depth is typically more effective at creating complex representations rather than width in neural networks. Depth is measured by the count of hidden layers stacked one on top of the other in the network. Hence, the term deep neural networks. \n",
    "\n",
    "The Figure 2.4 below shows the results of an empirical study by Goodfellow, Shlens and Szegedy (2014) of accuracy of the network vs depth. Notice that accuracy increases rapidly with depth until about 8 layers, after which the effect is reduced. \n",

    "Another view of the empirical study by Goodfellow et. al. is shown in Figure 2.5 below. In this case accuracy verses number of model parameters is compared for three different network architectures. The deeper network (11 layers) makes more  efficient use of the parameters in terms of improved accuracy. The number of parameters in a layer is approximately the total number of parameters divided by the number of layers. Notice that for the particular case tested convolutional neural networks are more efficient than fully-connected networks. We will discuss convolutional neural networks in a subsequent lesson. \n",
    "\n",
    "Of particular interest is the fact that the fully-connected network and the shallow convolutional neural network appear to be over-fitting as the test accuracy actually decreases as the number of parameters increases. We will discuss the significant problems of over-fitting in neural networks in a subsequent lesson. \n",

The earliest work on this algorithm was by Kelly (1960) in the context of control theory and Bryson (1961) in the context of dynamic programming.

Their paper marks the modern history of neural networks, and set off the first wave of enthusiasm. \n",

In the general case, this process requires using automatic differentiation methods. \n",

    "### 3.1 Loss functions\n",
    "\n",
    "To train a neural network we must have a **loss function**, also known as a **cost function**. In simple terms, the loss function measures the fit of a model to the training data. The lower the loss, the better the fit. \n",
    "\n",
    "To train deep learning models **cross entropy** is often used as a loss function. This is an information theoretic measure of model fit. We can understand cross entropy as follows. \n",
    "\n",
    "First define **Shannon entropy** as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathbb{H}(I) = E[I(X)] = E[-ln_b(P(X))] = - \\sum_{i=1}^n P(x_i) ln_b(P(x_i)$$  \n",
    "Where:  \n",
    "$E[X] = $ the expectation of $X$.  \n",
    "$I(X) = $ the information content of $X$.   \n",
    "$P(X) = $ probability of $X$.  \n",
    "$b = $ base of the logarithm.    \n",
    "\n",
    "This rather abstract formula gives us a way to compute the expected information content of a set of values $X$. The more likely (higher probability) of $X$ the less informative it is. \n",
    "\n",
    "To create a loss function from the definition of Shannon entropy we start with the **Kullback-Leibler divergence (KL divergence)** or **relative entropy**. The KL divergence is an information theoretic measure of the difference between two distributions, $P(X)$ and $Q(X)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathbb{D}_{KL}(P \\parallel Q) = - \\sum_{i=1}^n p(x_i)\\ ln_b \\frac{p(x_i)}{q(x_i)}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Ideally, in the case of training a machine learning model we want a distribution $Q(X)$, which is identical to the actual data distribution $P(X)$. \n",
    "\n",
    "But, you may say, if we could know $P(X)$ why compute $Q(X)$ at all? Fortunately, we do not have to. We can rewrite the KL divergence as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathbb{D}_{KL}(P \\parallel Q) = \\sum_{i=1}^n p(x_i)\\ ln_b p(x_i) - \\sum_{i=1}^n p(x_i)\\ ln_b q(x_i)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Since $P(X)$ is fixed and we wish to find $Q(X)$ when we train our model, we can minimize the term on the right, which is the **cross entropy** defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathbb{H}(P,Q) = - \\sum_{i=1}^n p(x_i)\\ ln_b q(x_i)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "From the formulation of KL divergence above you can see the following.\n",

    "\\mathbb{D}_{KL}(P \\parallel Q) = Entropy(P) + Cross\\ Entropy(P,Q)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, we can minimize divergence by minimizing cross entropy. This idea is both intuitive and computationally attractive. The closer the estimated distribution $q(X)$ is to the distribution of the true underling process $p(X)$, the lower the cross entropy and the lower the KL divergence. \n",

    "In general we will not know $p(X)$. In fact, if we did, why would we need to solve a training problem? So, we can use the following approximation.\n",
