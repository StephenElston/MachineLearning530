    "## Brief history\n",
    "\n",
    "A restricted version of Bayes Theorem was proposed by Rev.Thomas Bayes (1702-1761). Bayes Theorem, was published postumously by his friend Richard Price. Bayes' interest was in probabilities of gambling games. He was also a supporter of Isac Newton's new theory of calculus, with his publication, *An Introduction to the Doctrine of Fluxions, and a Defence of the Mathematicians Against the Objections of the Author of The Analyst*.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](img/ThomasBayes.gif)\n",
    "\n",
    "Pierre-Simon Laplace published a version of Bayes Theorem, similar to its modern form, in his Essai philosophique sur les probabilités 1814. Laplace applied Baysian methods to problems in celestial mechanics. These problems had great practical implicatons in the late 18th and early 19th centuries for the safe navigaton of ships. \n",
    " \n",
    "![](img/Laplace.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "The geophysicist and mathemtician Harold Jefferys extensively used Bayes' methods. His 1939 book, *The Theory of Probability* was in deliberate opposition to Fisher's methods using p-values.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](img/JeffreysProbability.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Dispite the philosophical squables, Baysian methods endured and showed an increasing number of success stories. Pragmatists continued to use both approaches. A number of success during the Second World War, with the philosophical battles raging, included:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Bayesian models were used to improve artillery accuracy in both world wars. In particular the Soviet statistian Kolmagorov used Bayes methods to greatly improve artillery accuracy. \n",
    "- Bayesian models were used by Alan Turing to break German codes.\n",
    "- Bernard Koopman, working for the British Royal Navy, improved the ability to locate U-boats using directional data from intercepted radio transmissions. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Starting in the second half of the 20th century the convergance of greater computing power and general acceptance lead to the following notable advances in computational Baysian methods.\n",

    "## Baysian vs. Frequentist Views\n",
    "\n",
    "The battle between Fisher, Jefferys and their protégés continued for most of the 20th century. This battle was bitter and often personal. The core of these argument were:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Fisher argued that the selection of a Bayesian prior distribution was purely subjective, allowing one to achieve any answer desired.\n",
    "- Jefferys argued that all knowledge is in fact subjective, and that choosing a confidence interval was subjective in any event.\n",
    "\n",
    "With greater compuational power and general acceptance, Bayes methods are now widely used in areas ranging from medical research to natural language understanding to web search. Amoung pragmatists, the common belief today is that some problems are better handled by Frequentist methods and some with Bayesian methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's summarize the differences between the Baysian and Frequentist views. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Bayesian methods use priors to quantify what we know about parameters.\n",
    "- Frequentists do not quantify anything about the parameters, using p-values and confidence intervals to express the unknowns about parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recalling that both views are useful, we can contrast these methods with a chart.\n",

The confidence interval is chosen on the distribution of a test statistic, whereas the credible interval is computed on the posterior distribution of the parameter. For symetric distributions the credible interval can be numerically the same as the confidence interval. However, in the general case, these two quantities can be quite different.  \n",
