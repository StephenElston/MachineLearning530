    "Bootstrap and resampling are widely applicable statistical methods which relax many of the assumptions of clasical statistics. Resampling methods draw heavily on the CLT. Specifically resampling methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Allow computation of statistics from limited data\n",
    "- Compute statistic from multiple subsamples of dataset\n",
    "- Minimal distribution assumptions\n",
    "- Computationally intensive\n",
    "\n",
    "Commonly used resampling methods include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Randomization or Permutation methods: e.g. Fisher's exact test\n",
    "- Bootstrap: resample with equivalent size and replacement\n",
    "- Jackknife: leave one out resampling\n",
    "- Cross validation: resample into folds without replacement\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Pitfalls\n",
    "\n",
    "But, there is no magic involved. When using resampling methods always keep in mind the several pitfalls:\n",
    "- If sample is biased, resample statistic is biased\n",
    "- Sample variance and Cis are no better than sample allows\n",

    "## History\n",
    "\n",
    "### Randomization and permutation methods\n",
    "\n",
    "Randomization and permutation methods were pioneered by Fisher as early as 1911. Fisher fully developed the theory in his 1935 book. Scalability of these methods remain limited, even with modern computers. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Cross-validaton\n",
    "\n",
    "Cross-validation was origianlly proposed by Kurtz in 1948. Mosier extended the method to double cross validation in 1951. The modern method of nested or multicoross-validation were introduced by Krus and Fuller in 1982. Today, cross-validation is widely used in the testing of machine learning models. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Jack knife methods\n",
    "\n",
    "Maurice Quenouille originally suggested this method in 1949. The jack knife was fully developed\n",
    "by John W. Tukey, who gave the method its name, in 1958. Tukey saw that method as a simple tool useful for many purposes like a pocket knife. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Bootstrap \n",
    "\n",
    "The bootstrap method was first suggested by Efron and Hinkley in 1978 and further developed by Efron in 1979. A full treatment was provided in Efron's 1980 book. \n",
