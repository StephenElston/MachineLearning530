    "In this lesson you will explore **recurrent neural networks (RNNs)**. Recurrent neural networks use a distinctive model which is suitable for sequence data. Sequence data can include human speech, natural language, and numerical time series. Natural language applications include machine translation and question response systems. RNNs can also be applied to multi-dimensional data. For example, RNNs are used to caption images.   \n",
    "\n",
    "The idea of RNNs is not new. In the early days of the last surge in interest in neural networks, the basic architecture was proposed by Rumelhart et. al. (1986). The idea remained in limited use, until Hochreiter and Schmidhuber proposed the Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) network in 1997. By 2007, LSTM RNNs completely dominated speach recognition, displacing decades of work on Hidden Markov Models. See, for example, Fernandez et. al (2007). RNNs remain an active area of research with improvements appearing regularly. \n",

    "### 1.1 Basic recurrence relationships for neural networks\n",
    "\n",
    "**Recurrent neural networks (RNNs)** use recurrence operations to operate on **sequences**. But, what do we mean by a recurrence? Simply put, recurrent functions are functions that call themselves to process values of a sequence. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look at a simple example. Start with a function that operates on a value at one time step to compute an output at the next time step. We can write such a function as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$s^{(t)} = f(s^{(t-1)}; \\theta)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This apply this functional relation once again applied again to compute the output at the next time step. This first recurrent relationship can be written as follows.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$s^{(t+1)} = f(f(s^{(t-1)}; \\theta); \\theta)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We can continue in this way to compute the output of any **finite** sequence of inputs. It is important to understand that this recurrence relationship in not defined for an infinite length sequence. In practice, all problems for which we apply the recurrence relationship are finite. \n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that the recurrence relationship introduces **memory**. Output values depend on the history of inputs. The memory property of this model differentiates it from many classical time series models. In technical terms we can say the recurrence model is **non-Markovian**, where a **Markov process** is memoryless.   "

    "### 1.2 Basic recurrent neural network architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "How do we create a neural network with a recurrence relationship? A single hidden layer recurrent neural network is illustrated in Figure 1.1 below. The hidden layer of this network has a recurrent or feedback path. This RNN produces an output value (or vector) for each input.     \n",

    "<center>**Figure 1.1. Basic architecture of a recurrent process**</center>\n",
    "\n",
    "Figure 1.1 illustrates the concept of an RNN. But, how can this architecture be used to perform actual computations? The answer is to **unfold** the recurrence relationship. This unfolding is illustrated in Figure 1.2. Notice that the unfolded network represents a long sequence of calculations. \n",

    "<center>**Figure 1.2. Unrolled basic recurrent process**</center>\n",
    "\n",
    "The capital letters in Figure 1.2 represent weight tensors of the model. It is these weight tensors that must be learned when training an RNN. Typically, these weight tensors are learned by using **back propagation through time (BPTT)**. BPTT is a generalization of the general back propagation algorithm. \n",
    "\n",
    "The weight tensor $W$ defines the recurrence. You can see that this connection from one time step to another introduces memory into the model. \n",
    "\n",
    "Given these weight tensors the feed-forward calculation for a multinomial classifier RRN can be written as follows:  \n",
    "\n",
    "$$a^{(t)} = b + W h^{(t-1)} + Ux^{(t)}\\\\\n",
    "h^{(t)} = tanh(a^{(t)})\\\\\n",
    "o^{(t)} = c + Vh^{(t)}\\\\\n",
    "\\hat{y}^{(t)} = softmax(o^{(t)})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "These relationships are relatively complex. This is especially the case when compared to basic fully-connected networks. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the equations above notice that there is only a dependency on the previous activation, $h^{(t-1)}$, and the current input, $x^{(t)}$. There is no dependency on anything that occurs after the current time step. Therefore, we can stay that this basic recurrent neural network is **causal**. For many problems in sequence analysis causality is an essential property. For example, in a forecasting application there will never be any information available beyond the present. \n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that the weight tensors of the RNN are the same at each time step. This fact has two important implications.\n",
    "1. These **Shared weight** tensors are learned. This makes the training of RNNs tractable. Further, the statistical strength of the training is increased. \n",
    "2. The RNN can only be used to model **stationary** sequences. A stationary sequence has statistical properties (e.g. variance) that are **invariant with time**.   "

    "We will not dive deeply into NLP for this lesson since our focus is on RNNs. However, a bit of background will help you understand what is going on.\n",
    "\n",
    "First a bit of terminology. We talk about a **corpus**, which a collection of **documents**. A document can take many forms; a email, a tweet, a news article, a book, a chapter from a book, a paragraph, etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are a great many models which have been tried for text analytics and **natural language processing (NLP)**. Typically, NLP with raw text requires significant preparation.  A few of many possible preparation steps include: \n",
    "- Text is normalized, which can involve many steps such as setting characters to lower case, removing punctuation, numbers and special characters. \n",
    "- In some cases, **stop words** are removed. Stop words are common words with no semantic value, such as 'the' or 'and'. \n",
    "- Normalized text is **tokenized**. There are a number of ways to tokenize text. Most commonly, the tokens are the words in the document. Tokens can also be characters or any other division of the document that make semantic sense. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will only discuss a few of common models briefly here: \n",
    "\n",
    "- The **bag of words model (BOW)** is a simple, widely used, and surprisingly effective model for analysis of text data. The BOW model assumes **exchangeability** of words. The BOW model depends only on the frequency of the words in the document. The order of the words is not considered. Despite these seemingly ridiculous assumptions, this model works well in many cases. The end product of applying the BOW model is a term-document or document-term matrix. The tdm, or dtm is a structured representation of word frequency by document. The tdm or dtm can be used for classification if labels are available or clustering for unsupervised learning. In general the tdm or dtm are extremely sparse. Most words in a typical corpus do not show up in most documents. This sparsity requires that special data structures are used for storage and manipulation. Further, the sparse representation leads to statistical issues. \n",
    "- The **N-gram** model uses all possible sequences of N words. For example, the 3-gram of the sentence 'The cat sat on the mat' are as follows:\n",
    " - All possible 1-grams; the, cat, sat, on, mat. Note that the 1-gram model is close to the BOW model. \n",
    " - All possible 2-grams; the cat, cat sat, sat on, on the, the mat. \n",
    " - All possible 3-grams; the cat sat, cat sat on, sat on the, on the mat. \n",
    "- Another widely used model is **Part of Speech (PoS) Tagging**. PoS tagging attempts to label or annotate words in a corpus (e.g. a collection of documents) as, say nouns, verbs, pronouns, etc. PoS tagging is beyond the  scope of this Lesson. The PoS tagger creates a tree of the relationship of words in say a sentence. One useful specialization of PoS tagging is named entity recognition, which attempts to find proper nouns. \n",
    "\n",
    "With the advent of deep learning, **text embedding models** have come into common use. Embedding models map the tokens (typically words) in the documents to a dense space of learned features. The dense representation has significant statistical advantages when training models. Further minimal storage is required for the dense representation. \n",
    "\n",
    "Similar words lie near each other in the embedding space in a manner that preserves semantic relationships. This relationship between some words is shown schematically in Figure 2.2. You can see that simpler words are close to each other. Further, words with similar semantic relationships are along nearly parallel vectors in this space.    \n",
    "\n",
    "![](img/Embedding.JPG)\n",
    "<center>**Figure 2.2. Schematic diagram of embedding relationship between common words**</center>\n",
    "\n",
    "Text embedding has been shown to work extremely well in practice. Unfortunately, like many topics in deep learning, theory has not caught up with practice. Beyond the conceptual level theory is sketchy. The most readable source on the theory of embedding is the [article by Rong](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1411.2738.pdf)."

    "It may have caught your notice that convolutional neural networks could be applied to many of the applications discussed in this lesson. This is in fact the case. For example, a one-dimensional seequence can be modeled by either an RNN or a one-dimensional covnet. \n",
    "\n",
    "In some cases covnets have proved superior. This superior performance likely results from the simpler and easier to train model. However, if the underlying process operates over long time scales, then an RNN with memory will likely be superior, since covnets have no memory. \n",

    "Emperical evidence indicates that one can only decide which architecture is better for a given application by either deep understanding  of the underlying process, actual testing or both. Testing the various purmutations of these two basic architectures can be quite time consumming. However there  "

    "\n",
    "So far, we have only considered RNN architectures which perform a **single task**. In our examples this task is to estimate sentiment in movie reviews. However, many, if not most, real-world AI applications require more than one task. We say that systems that perform multiple tasks are **multi-task architectures**. Conventionally, these tasks were all performed by independent systems. An advantage of deep architectures is that the multiple tasks can be performed in one stack. Further, the machine learning engineer does not need to explicitly engineer features for these tasks. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look at a examples of multi-task architecture. Real time translation of human speach to another language. At the minimum there are  four tasks:\n",
    "- Compute the words in the utterance from the spoken phenomes. \n",
    "- Apply NLP to determine the context of the utterance. \n",
    "- Create the sequuence of words in the other language. \n",
    "- And finally, create the sequence phenomes to form the utterance understandable to the speaker of the other language. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this particular application two of the tasks are predictive. But the two other tasks are **generative**. That is, the purpose of these tasks is to compute an output sequence given an input. \n",
    "\n",
    "Figure 9.0 shows a schematic architecture for multi-task deep learning. In this  case, the end-to-end task is to transforming utterances in one  language to utterences in another language. \n",

    "\n",
    "While the tasks are shown as descrete steps, a deep learning  neural network would perform all of of these tasks. This approach has the advantage that training is end-to-end. Thus, the perforance and training loss is measured on the complete complex task not the individual steps. "
