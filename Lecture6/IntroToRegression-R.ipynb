    "\n",
    "The method of regression is one of the oldest and most widely used analytics methods. The goal of regression is to produce a model that represents the ‘best fit’ to some observed data. Typically the model is a function describing some type of curve (lines, parabolas, etc.) that is determined by a set of parameters (e.g., slope and intercept). “Best fit” means that there is an optimal set of parameters according to an evaluation criteria we choose.\n",
    "\n",
    "A regression models attempt to predict the value of one variable, known as the **dependent variable**, **response variable** or **label**, using the values of other variables, known as **independent variables**, **explainatory variables** or **features**. Single regression has one feature used to predict a label. Multiple regression uses two of more feature variables. \n",
    "\n",
    "Virtually all machine learning models, including some of the latest deep learning methods, are a form of regression. There methods often suffer from the same problems, including overfitting and mathematically unstable fitting methods. \n",
    "\n",
    "Linear regression is the foundational form of regression. In linear regression the squared error of the predictions of the dependent variable using the independent variable. This approach is know as the **method of least squares**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## History\n",
    "\n",
    "Regression is based on the method of least squares or the method of minimum mean square error. The ideas around least squares or averaging errors have occured over nearly three centruies. The fist known publication of a 'method of avergages' was by the German astronomer Tobias Mayer in 1750. Lapace used a similar method which he published in 1788.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](img/TobiasMayer.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "The first publication of the method or least squares was by the French mathematician Adrien-Marie Legendre in 1805. \n",
    "\n",
    "![](img/Legendre.jpg)\n",
    "<center>**Caricature of Legendre**, published method of least squares</center>\n",
    "\n",
    "It is very likely that the German physicist and mathematician Gauss developed the method of least squares as early as 1795, but did not publish the method until 1809, aside from a reference in a letter in 1799. Gauss never disputed Legendre's priority in publication. Legendre did not return the favor, and opposed any notion that Gauss had used the method earlier. \n",
    "\n",
    "![](img/Carl_Friedrich_Gauss.jpg)\n",
    "<center>**Carl Friedrich Gauss**, early adoptor of least squares</center>\n",
    "\n",
    "The first use of the term **regression** was by Francis Gaulton, a cousin of Charles Darwin, in 1886. Gaulton was interested in determining which traits of plants and animals, including humans, could be said to be inherited. \n",
    "\n",
    "<center>![](img/Francis_Galton.jpg)\n",
    "**Francis Galton**, inventor of regression</center>\n",
    "\n",
    "While Gaulton invented a modern form regression, it fell to Karl Pearson to put regression and multiple regression on a firm mathematical footing. Pearson's 1898 publication proposed a method of regression as we understand it today. \n",
    "\n",
    "Many others have expanded the theory of regression in the 120 years since Pearson's paper. Notably, Joseph Berkson published the logistic regression method in 1944, one of the first classification algorithms. In recent times the interest in machine learning has lead to a rapid increase in the numbers and types of regression models. "
